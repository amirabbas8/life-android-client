        <!--There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share-->
        <!--information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share-->
        <!--information with us, for example by creating a Life(and Saoshyant) Account, we can make-->

        <!--services, we want you to be clear how we\'re using information and the ways in which you can-->
        <!--protect your privacy.-->
        <!--Our Privacy Policy explains:-->

        <!--• How we use that information.-->
        <!--• The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.-->
        <!--We\'ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you\'re not familiar with terms like-->

        <!--privacy matters to Life(and Saoshyant) so whether you are new to Life(and Saoshyant) or a-->

        <!--questions contact us.-->

        <!--Information we collect-->
        <!--We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out-->
        <!--basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\'ll-->
        <!--find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which Video videos you might-->
        <!--like.-->
        <!--We collect information in the following ways:-->
        <!--• Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a-->
        <!--Life(and Saoshyant) Account. When you do, we\'ll ask for personal information, like your-->
        <!--name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want-->
        <!--to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a-->
        <!--publicly visible Life(and Saoshyant) Profile, which may include your name and photo.-->
        <!--• Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the-->
        <!--services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on Video, visit a-->
        <!--website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content.-->
        <!--This information includes:-->
        <!--o Device information-->
        <!--We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system-->

        <!--? device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser-->

        <!--? cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Life(and Saoshyant) Account.-->
        <!--o Location information-->
        <!--When you use Life(and Saoshyant) services, we may collect and process information about your-->

        <!--on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.-->
        <!--o Unique application numbers-->
        <!--Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your-->
        <!--installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be-->
        <!--sent to Life(and Saoshyant) when you install or uninstall that service or when that service-->
        <!--periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.-->
        <!--o Local storage-->
        <!--We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device-->

        <!--information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising-->
        <!--services or Life(and Saoshyant) features that may appear on other sites. Our Life(and-->

        <!--Information we collect when you are signed in to Life(and Saoshyant), in addition to-->
        <!--information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your Life(and-->

        <!--services we offer that require a Life(and Saoshyant) Account. In addition, we may replace-->
        <!--past names associated with your Life(and Saoshyant) Account so that you are represented-->
        <!--consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other-->
        <!--information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Life(and Saoshyant)-->
        <!--Profile information, such as your name and photo.-->

        <!--improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we-->
        <!--use to do this on our own services is Life(and Saoshyant) Analytics. For example, by saving-->

        <!--prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or-->
        <!--similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion,-->

        <!--Transparency and choice-->
        <!--People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we-->
        <!--collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:-->
        <!--• Review and update your Life(and Saoshyant) activity controls to decide what types of data,-->
        <!--such as videos you\'ve watched on Video or past searches, you would like saved with your-->
        <!--account when you use Life(and Saoshyant) services.-->

        <!--services.-->
        <!--• Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that-->
        <!--appear in ads.-->
        <!--You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our-->
        <!--services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it\'s important to-->
        <!--remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.-->
        <!--For example, we may not remember your language preferences.-->

        <!--Information you share-->
        <!--Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share-->
        <!--information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Life(and Saoshyant).-->
        <!--Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.-->

        <!--Accessing and updating your personal information-->
        <!--Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal-->
        <!--information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly-->
        <!--or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal-->
        <!--purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity-->
        <!--before we can act on your request.-->
        <!--We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical-->
        <!--effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing-->
        <!--practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance,-->
        <!--requests concerning information residing on backup systems).-->
        <!--Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where-->
        <!--it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that-->
        <!--protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you-->
        <!--delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our-->
        <!--active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.-->

        <!--Information we share-->
        <!--We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside-->
        <!--of Life(and Saoshyant) unless one of the following circumstances applies:-->
        <!--• With your consent-->
        <!--We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of-->
        <!--Life(and Saoshyant) when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the-->
        <!--sharing of any sensitive personal information.-->
        <!--• With domain administrators-->
        <!--If your Life(and Saoshyant) Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for-->
        <!--example, for Life(and Saoshyant) Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers-->
        <!--who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Life(and Saoshyant)-->
        <!--Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be-->
        <!--able to:-->
        <!--o view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you-->
        <!--install.-->
        <!--o change your account password.-->
        <!--o suspend or terminate your account access.-->
        <!--o access or retain information stored as part of your account.-->
        <!--o receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal-->
        <!--process or enforceable governmental request.-->
        <!--o restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.-->
        <!--Please refer to your domain administrator\'s privacy policy for more information.-->
        <!--• For external processing-->
        <!--We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to-->
        <!--process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and-->
        <!--any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.-->
        <!--• For legal reasons-->
        <!--We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of-->
        <!--Life(and Saoshyant) if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or-->
        <!--disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:-->
        <!--o meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.-->
        <!--o enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.-->
        <!--o detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.-->
        <!--o protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Life(and Saoshyant), our users-->
        <!--or the public as required or permitted by law.-->
        <!--We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like-->
        <!--publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly-->
        <!--to show trends about the general use of our services.-->
        <!--If Life(and Saoshyant) is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue-->
        <!--to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice-->
        <!--before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.-->

        <!--Information security-->
        <!--We work hard to protect Life(and Saoshyant) and our users from unauthorized access to or-->
        <!--unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:-->
        <!--• We encrypt many of our services using SSL.-->
        <!--• We offer you two step verification when you access your Life(and Saoshyant) Account-->
        <!--• We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical-->
        <!--security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.-->
        <!--• We restrict access to personal information to Life(and Saoshyant) employees, contractors-->
        <!--and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are-->
        <!--subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or-->
        <!--terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.-->

        <!--When this Privacy Policy applies-->
        <!--Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Life(and Saoshyant) Inc. and-->
        <!--its affiliates, including Video, services Life(and Saoshyant) provides on Android devices,-->
        <!--and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes-->
        <!--services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.-->
        <!--Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals,-->
        <!--including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may-->
        <!--include Life(and Saoshyant) services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy-->
        <!--Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who-->
        <!--advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve-->
        <!--and offer relevant ads.-->

        <!--Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities-->
        <!--We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self-->
        <!--regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person-->
        <!--who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities,-->
        <!--including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the-->
        <!--transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.-->

        <!--Changes-->
        <!--Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this-->
        <!--Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on-->
