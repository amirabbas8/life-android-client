# Life

Life is my third Android App.It's a social network app with features such as Following, Like, play videos and etc.
Life is a good toturial to unserstand basics of Android programming.
I wrote it in Java but codes has changed to Kotlin. I had started programming of Life before going to University so codes are realy simple but it has almost complete functionality
